Community Plan
==============

The Support Plan, It is all about giving back!
Team Tronics thanks the community for their incredible support and would like to present our plan if we were to be elected as one of the Super Representatives.

First and foremost, we believe that for any plan to be effective the community must feel it has a voice. If elected it's our mission to build and maintain a platform that gives all members an equal voice. Every member of the Tronics community will have the ability to suggest, vote, and participate in Tronics supported projects. TRON has developed one of the industry's leading blockchain environments, and with that we feel it is our responsibility to build an ecosystem alongside this environment that facilitates a fluidity to its users greater than what has been seen before. It is our goal to become a liaison between the core technology within TRON's network and community driven efforts to expand on this technology helping both TRON and its technology flourish.
